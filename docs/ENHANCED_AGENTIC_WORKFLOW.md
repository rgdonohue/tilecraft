# 🤖 Enhanced Agentic Workflow for Tilecraft

## **Current Project State: READY FOR AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT**

Your project is at the **ideal stage** for agentic development - professional structure with stubbed implementations ready for AI completion.

## **🎯 Priority Development Sprints (AI-Assisted)**

### **Sprint 1: OSM Data Pipeline (2-3 hours)**

#### **Cursor Composer Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Complete OSM downloader with error handling
"Implement robust OSM data downloading in src/tilecraft/core/osm_downloader.py using Overpass API with retry logic, progress tracking, and comprehensive error handling for network failures and API limits"

# 2. Implement feature extraction with osmium
"Replace the stub in src/tilecraft/core/feature_extractor.py with actual osmium-tool integration that filters OSM data by feature types, handles tag variations, and exports clean GeoJSON files"

# 3. Add comprehensive OSM validation
"Enhance src/tilecraft/utils/validation.py with OSM-specific validation functions that check for valid geometries, required tags, and data completeness"
```

#### **AI Context Prompts:**
```markdown
Context: I'm building Tilecraft, an AI-assisted geospatial CLI. The OSM processing pipeline needs to handle:
- Bounding box downloads from Overpass API
- Feature filtering with osmium-tool
- Tag disambiguation for inconsistent OSM data
- Memory-efficient processing for large regions

Please implement with proper error handling, caching, and progress feedback.
```

### **Sprint 2: AI Integration (1-2 hours)**

#### **Cursor Composer Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Implement schema generation with fallbacks
"Complete src/tilecraft/ai/schema_generator.py with OpenAI/Anthropic API integration using the prompt templates, include fallback to default schemas, and add schema validation"

# 2. Build style generation with palette support
"Implement AI-powered MapLibre style generation in src/tilecraft/ai/style_generator.py that creates cohesive styles based on palette moods, includes accessibility checks, and validates against MapLibre spec"

# 3. Add tag disambiguation with fuzzy matching
"Create intelligent OSM tag disambiguation in src/tilecraft/ai/tag_disambiguator.py that uses AI + fuzzy matching to resolve tag variations like natural=wood vs landuse=forest"
```

#### **AI Context Integration:**
```markdown
Load these contexts before AI calls:
1. OSM tag documentation (via MCP)
2. MapLibre GL JS style specification
3. Color palette psychology for geographic features
4. Accessibility guidelines for cartographic styling
```

### **Sprint 3: Vector Tile Generation (1 hour)**

#### **Cursor Composer Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Complete tippecanoe integration
"Finish src/tilecraft/core/tile_generator.py with full tippecanoe command generation, zoom-level optimization based on feature types, and memory management for large datasets"

# 2. Add tile validation and optimization
"Implement MBTiles validation and optimization in src/tilecraft/utils/validation.py including tile size checks, zoom level validation, and attribute optimization"
```

## **🔄 Continuous AI Assistance Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: Context-Aware Development**
```bash
# Before each development session:
"Load geospatial context: I'm working on Tilecraft, a CLI tool that processes OSM data into vector tiles. Current task: [specific feature]. Consider memory efficiency, error handling, and GIS best practices."
```

### **Pattern 2: Test-First AI Development**
```bash
# Generate tests first, then implementation:
"Create comprehensive pytest tests for [feature] that cover edge cases like invalid geometries, network failures, and large datasets. Then implement the feature to pass all tests."
```

### **Pattern 3: AI Code Review**
```bash
# After each implementation:
"Review this geospatial processing code for performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, edge cases with invalid geometries, and compliance with OGC standards."
```

## **🛠️ Advanced Agentic Techniques**

### **1. AI-Powered Debugging**
```bash
# When encountering errors:
"Debug this geospatial processing error. Context: OSM data processing with osmium-tool. Error: [paste error]. Analyze potential causes including invalid geometries, memory limits, and projection issues."
```

### **2. Performance Optimization with AI**
```bash
# For optimization:
"Optimize this geospatial processing function for large datasets. Consider streaming processing, spatial indexing, and memory-efficient algorithms. Target: process regions up to 100MB OSM data."
```

### **3. AI-Assisted Documentation**
```bash
# Auto-generate documentation:
"Generate comprehensive docstrings and usage examples for this geospatial function. Include parameter descriptions, return types, error conditions, and GIS-specific considerations."
```

## **🚀 AI Development Accelerators**

### **Smart Cursor Usage:**
1. **Tab Completion**: Let AI complete repetitive geospatial patterns
2. **Composer for Features**: Use for complete feature implementation
3. **Chat for Architecture**: Discuss complex GIS algorithms
4. **Apply for Refactoring**: Optimize existing code

### **Context Management:**
```bash
# Maintain consistent context across sessions:
"Previous context: Tilecraft CLI tool for OSM->vector tiles. Current architecture: [brief summary]. Working on: [current feature]. Use established patterns from existing codebase."
```

### **AI Pair Programming:**
```bash
# Collaborative development:
"Act as my GIS domain expert. I'll implement the core logic, you suggest optimizations, error handling, and edge cases specific to geospatial data processing."
```

## **📊 Success Metrics**
