## üìà Core Development Progress

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED: Major Milestone - Robust OSM Feature Extraction**

The OSM feature extraction system is now complete and production-ready:

**üîß Core Implementation:**
- **Custom OSM Handler**: Complete `OSMFeatureHandler` using osmium Python bindings
- **Robust Processing**: Handles nodes, ways, and relations with proper geometry determination
- **Tag Filtering**: Advanced tag matching including wildcards and pattern support
- **Smart Geometry**: Automatic determination of Point/LineString/Polygon geometries based on OSM tags and closure
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming processing with configurable memory limits

**‚ö° Performance & Reliability:**
- **Progress Tracking**: Rich progress bars with real-time status updates
- **Comprehensive Validation**: OSM file validation (XML/PBF), GeoJSON output validation
- **Intelligent Caching**: Full integration with cache manager for features and intermediate results
- **Custom Tags Support**: Configurable custom tag mappings via configuration
- **Cleanup Management**: Automatic temporary file cleanup

**üß™ Testing Excellence (27 Tests, 64% Coverage):**
- **OSM Handler Tests**: Tag matching, geometry creation, type determination
- **Feature Extractor Tests**: Initialization, mappings, file validation, caching, error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Cache hit/miss scenarios, custom tags, extraction workflows
- **Error Scenarios**: Empty files, invalid formats, processing failures
- **Mock Testing**: Proper mocking of osmium operations for reliable testing

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Integration:**
- **Configuration**: Full integration with Pydantic configuration models

- **Error Recovery**: Rate limiting, timeout handling, exponential backoff ‚úÖ
- **Async Downloads**: HTTP streaming with progress indicators ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 11 unit tests with 100% critical path coverage ‚úÖ

#### Development Infrastructure
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with fixtures, mocking, coverage reporting ‚úÖ
- **Code Quality**: Black formatting, ruff linting, mypy type checking ‚úÖ
- **Dependencies**: Complete geospatial stack (GDAL, osmium, fiona, shapely) ‚úÖ
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python environment with all dependencies ‚úÖ

## üîÑ Next Development Phase

With robust OSM feature extraction complete, the next major component is **Vector Tile Generation**:

### üéØ **NEXT: Vector Tile Generation Integration**

**Objective**: Implement production-ready vector tile generation using tippecanoe integration

**Key Components**:
1. **Tippecanoe Integration**: Command building and execution
2. **Zoom Configuration**: Feature-type specific zoom level optimization  
3. **Performance Tuning**: Memory management and processing chunks
4. **Output Validation**: MBTiles format verification
5. **Error Handling**: Tippecanoe error parsing and recovery

### üöÄ **Recommended Development Session**

**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Complexity**: Moderate (building on established patterns)

**Cursor Composer Prompt**:
```
I need to implement robust vector tile generation for Tilecraft following the established patterns from OSM downloader and feature extractor. 

Complete src/tilecraft/core/tile_generator.py with:

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Integration with tippecanoe command-line tool
2. Feature-type specific zoom level configuration  
3. GeoJSON to MBTiles conversion pipeline
4. Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
5. Progress tracking with Rich progress bars
6. Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
7. Output validation and verification
8. Caching integration for generated tiles
9. Professional logging throughout
10. Complete unit test suite

PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
- Error handling patterns from OSMDownloader (custom exceptions, retry logic)
- Progress tracking from FeatureExtractor (Rich progress bars)
- Configuration integration from existing models
- Caching patterns from CacheManager
- Type safety with comprehensive type hints

ARCHITECTURE:
- TileGenerator class with tippecanoe integration
- Custom exceptions: TileGenerationError, TippecanoeError, ValidationError
- Progress tracking for multi-stage processing
- Zoom-level optimization based on feature types
- Output format validation
- Temporary file management with cleanup

INPUT: List of GeoJSON files from feature extraction
OUTPUT: MBTiles file with proper zoom levels and layer organization

Follow the established professional code quality standards with comprehensive error handling, logging, and testing.
