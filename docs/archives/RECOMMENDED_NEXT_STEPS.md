# ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Next Steps for Tilecraft Development

## âš¡ Start Here (Next 30 minutes)

### 1. **Install System Dependencies**
```bash
# macOS (you're on Darwin 24.5.0)
brew install osmium-tool tippecanoe gdal

# Verify everything is working
osmium --version && tippecanoe --version && gdalinfo --version
```

### 2. **Bootstrap Project with AI**
**Single Cursor Composer Command** - Copy/paste this exactly:
```
Generate a complete Python CLI project structure for tilecraft based on the PRD.md. Create:

1. pyproject.toml with dependencies: click, rich, pydantic, osmium, openai, anthropic, pytest
2. src/tilecraft/ package with __init__.py
3. src/tilecraft/cli.py with Click CLI accepting --bbox, --features, --palette, --output
4. src/tilecraft/models/config.py with Pydantic models for BoundingBox, FeatureConfig  
5. Basic test structure with pytest
6. .env.example with API key placeholders
7. .gitignore for Python projects
8. README.md with installation and usage instructions

Use modern Python patterns, type hints, and follow the project structure outlined in project_structure.md
```

### 3. **Set Up Environment**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (after pyproject.toml is created)
pip install -e .

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your API keys
```

## ðŸš€ First Development Sprint (Next 2 hours)

### Priority Commands for Cursor Composer:

**Command 1: Core OSM Integration**
```
Implement src/tilecraft/core/osm_downloader.py that:
- Converts bounding box to Overpass API query
- Downloads OSM data with caching to avoid re-downloads
- Validates downloaded data
- Shows progress with rich progress bars
- Handles network errors gracefully
Include comprehensive error handling and logging
```

**Command 2: AI Schema Generation**
```
Implement src/tilecraft/ai/schema_generator.py that:
- Takes feature types (rivers, forest, water) as input
- Calls OpenAI/Anthropic to generate vector tile schema
- Returns structured schema with geometry types, attributes, zoom levels
- Includes retry logic and API key validation
- Has fallback default schemas if AI fails
Use the prompt templates from the PRD.md
```

**Command 3: Basic Feature Extraction**
```
Implement src/tilecraft/core/feature_extractor.py that:
- Uses osmium to filter OSM data by feature type
- Handles fuzzy tag matching (natural=wood vs landuse=forest)
- Outputs clean GeoJSON files for each feature type
- Validates geometry and fixes common issues
- Reports statistics on features extracted
```

**Command 4: Integration Test**
```
Create tests/test_integration.py with a complete end-to-end test:
- Uses a tiny real bounding box (single city block)
- Downloads OSM data
- Extracts features
- Generates AI schema
- Validates all outputs
- Runs in under 30 seconds
Make this the smoke test for the entire pipeline
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Milestones

After the first sprint, you should have:
- [ ] `tilecraft --help` shows proper CLI help
- [ ] Can download OSM data for a small area
- [ ] AI generates schemas for basic feature types
- [ ] Integration test passes
- [ ] Proper project structure with clean separation

## ðŸ”¥ Power Development Patterns

### Use These Cursor Patterns:
1. **"Fix this error: [paste error]"** - Cursor is excellent at debugging
2. **"Optimize this function for performance"** - AI will suggest improvements
3. **"Add comprehensive error handling to this module"** - AI adds robust error checking
4. **"Generate tests for this function"** - AI creates thorough test cases
5. **"Document this code with docstrings"** - AI adds proper documentation

### AI-First Development Flow:
1. **Write failing test first**: "Create a test for bounding box validation"
2. **Ask AI to implement**: "Make this test pass with proper validation logic"
3. **Ask for improvements**: "Add edge case handling and better error messages"
4. **Generate documentation**: "Add docstrings and update README with this feature"

## ðŸš€ Week 1 Goals

- **Day 1-2**: Core CLI and OSM data pipeline
- **Day 3-4**: AI integration and schema generation  
- **Day 5-6**: Tippecanoe integration and MBTiles output
- **Day 7**: MapLibre style generation and preview

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Start Tiny**: Use bounding boxes like downtown areas first
2. **Cache Everything**: Implement caching from day 1 to speed up development
3. **Rich Feedback**: Use rich library for beautiful progress bars and output
4. **AI Debugging**: Paste errors directly into Cursor chat for instant fixes
5. **Test-Driven**: Write tests first, then implement - AI is great at this pattern

## ðŸ†˜ If You Get Stuck

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **GDAL installation issues**: Use conda instead of pip for geospatial packages
- **Osmium not found**: Ensure system PATH includes homebrew binaries
- **AI API errors**: Check .env file and API key validity
- **Memory issues**: Start with smaller bounding boxes (0.01 degree squares)

**Get Help From AI:**
```
I'm getting this error in my tilecraft development: [paste full error]
The error occurs when [describe what you were doing]
Here's the relevant code: [paste code section]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Next Command

**Copy and paste this into Cursor Composer right now:**
```
Based on the PRD.md and following the project structure in project_structure.md, generate a complete working Python CLI project for tilecraft. Start with the foundation: pyproject.toml, basic project structure, and a Click-based CLI that can parse the required arguments. Make it ready for immediate development.
```
