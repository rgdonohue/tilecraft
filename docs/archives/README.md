# üìÅ Archives Directory

This directory contains historical and development documents that are no longer actively maintained but may be useful for reference.

## üìã Archived Documents

### ü§ñ AI/Agentic Development Documents
- **[AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_LEARNINGS_REPORT.md](AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_LEARNINGS_REPORT.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of AI-assisted development patterns and best practices discovered during Tilecraft development
- **[AGENTIC_SETUP.md](AGENTIC_SETUP.md)** - Original setup guide for AI-assisted development workflow
- **[ENHANCED_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW.md](ENHANCED_AGENTIC_WORKFLOW.md)** - Detailed workflow patterns for AI-assisted software development
- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Claude-specific development notes and patterns

### üîß Development Process Documents
- **[IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS.md](IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS.md)** - Development task list and immediate priorities (historical)
- **[mcp-config.md](mcp-config.md)** - Model Context Protocol configuration documentation
- **[REAL_OUTPUT_ANALYSIS.md](REAL_OUTPUT_ANALYSIS.md)** - Analysis of actual Tilecraft output from early development
- **[RECOMMENDED_NEXT_STEPS.md](RECOMMENDED_NEXT_STEPS.md)** - Historical roadmap and next development priorities

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Decisions
- **[tech-decision.md](tech-decision.md)** - Historical technology stack decisions (Python vs Node.js analysis)

## üéØ Why These Documents Are Archived

These documents were archived because they:

1. **Contain historical information** that's no longer current
2. **Document development processes** rather than user-facing features
3. **Represent early development stages** that have been superseded
4. **Focus on AI/agentic development patterns** rather than Tilecraft-specific functionality
5. **Contain outdated technical decisions** that have been implemented

## üìñ When to Reference These Documents

### For Developers
- **Understanding project history** and evolution
- **Learning AI-assisted development patterns** for other projects
- **Reference for development methodology** and best practices
- **Understanding technical decision rationale**

### For Users
- **Generally not needed** - use main documentation instead
- **May be useful** for understanding project background
- **Reference only** if working on similar AI-assisted projects
